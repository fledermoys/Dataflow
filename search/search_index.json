Can be used to switch between compositions per job. If no composition is specified, or the specified composition cant be found in the Project, Dataflow will skip the row. Composition names need to match. aep Dataflow allows you to switch between After Effects Projects per job. This opens up the possibility to batch render across unlimited amounts of projects using the same machine and data source. Values must be absolute file paths. output Setting output values for your Jobs, allows you to have dynamic filenames and destinations for your renders. If not specified or empty, Dataflow will use the composition name. [Setting up dynamic filenames and output locations] render-settings Allows you to select an After Effects Render Settings Template for your outputs via your data source. Case Sensitive. Only use values that match installed Render Setting Templates on your machine. Otherwise you might get errors. If left empty, will use After Effects Default Render Settings output-module Allows you to select an After Effects Output Module Template for your outputs via your data source. Case Sensitive. Only use values that match installed Output Module Templates on your machine. Otherwise you might get errors. If left empty, will use After Effects Default Module Agent render-status This Column specifies the status of a render job. Allowing for the Agent to scan the data source for ready to render jobs and therefore allowing new data to come in dynamically for the bot to render. Once a job is sucessfully rendered, the Agent will set the render-status value to  finished. Must exist when using Agent.
